# Hyperskill_Kotlin_NumericMatrixProcessor

### Stage 1/6: Addition

Program takes the height and width of a matrix (matrix A) separated by spaces `height width` \
Then the program takes the values of the first row as space separated integers `1 2 3 4 ... n` \
This repeats until matrix A is filled.
The program does this again for matrix B.

The program then prints the result of matrix A + matrix B
