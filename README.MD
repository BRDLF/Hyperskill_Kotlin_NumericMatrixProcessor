# Hyperskill_Kotlin_NumericMatrixProcessor

This is the 9th project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's Kotlin course, and the 2nd under the "Kotlin Developer" course.

It is rated as a challenging difficulty project. The goal is to make a program that processes number matrices

I have included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
