# Hyperskill_Kotlin_NumericMatrixProcessor

### Stage 1/6: Addition

Pretty simple stuff. For the last few projects I'd been putting everything in a singleton and building from there. I don't know that I'll continue to do this.
For now, it's just a mess of functions, since I expect the goals of the project to change soon. \
Some functions are rather dense single-lines. I'm unsure how wise it is to do this. It might make things harder to diagnose in the future.
Though, I like how it looks at the moment.
